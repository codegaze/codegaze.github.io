# codegaze.github.io

This is the repository of my personal site codegaze.github.io I host in Github Pages.

## History

This repository started as a test to Github Pages, Jekyll and Poole.
After one month or so of use I decided it's time to change the default theme/files of Poole.
After 10 years or so of use I decided it's time to move to 11ty.
