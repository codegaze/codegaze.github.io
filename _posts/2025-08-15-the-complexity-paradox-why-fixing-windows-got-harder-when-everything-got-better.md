Windows machines. The gift and the curse of this world. And for the record, I've been using Macs for the past ten years, so what follows might just be a Windows problem or... who knows.

My experience goes from Windows 95 up to Windows 7, and apart from some hiccups here and there (yes Vista, I'm looking at you), some driver issues, and some early development tools that could take two to three days to get working, I had good feelings toward the operating system. After Windows 7, I lost touch a bit, and I always need some time to rewire my brain and work with the OS again.

But maybe that's part of the problem. Or maybe it's something deeper about how we've traded simplicity for sophistication.

## When Machines Decide to Have Opinions

There were two and a half cases that really made me question the nature of modern computing. Each one a perfect example of how our "improved" systems have become their own worst enemies.

**Case One(and a half): The TPM Tantrum**

One laptop decided, seemingly overnight, that it would return a cryptic TPM error demanding a full reset. Fine, we thought. Reset completed, problem solved. Two months later, the same machine had the audacity to reboot mid-email, trapping itself in an endless repair console loop with messages claiming it "couldn't repair Windows."

This time, even a reset wouldn't work. We had to download a specific manufacturer version of Windows, rebuild everything from scratch, and do it all while on the phone with a support team that was as mystified as we were. They had no real understanding of what had gone sideways and just asked to send them the laptop for fixing. We did it ourselves, of course.

**Case Two: The Sleepy Reboots**

Another PC started randomly rebooting when waking from sleep. No warning, no pattern, no apparent reason. The logs pointed to the ever unhelpful "Error 41," which, for the uninitiated, is Windows-speak for "Kernel-Power failure." It's a generic "your system shut down unexpectedly" notice that could mean anything from a bad driver to a failing power supply to a cosmic ray flipping a bit in RAM. In plain English, it's Windows shrugging and saying, "Something happened." Still no fix. The machine works fine until it doesn't, which is somehow worse than a failure you can count on.

## Do They Make Them Like They Used To?

A few weeks earlier, I joked about the old days when you had a problem with your machine. You either had a "tech" person (usually someone's cousin who "knew computers") who would most probably format your PC, or you would do it yourself. The nuclear option was the only option and you also had to cancel everything for the weekend. You had a lot of work to do!

If you saw a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), you didn't have a lot of choices. You would either format everything and start fresh-and everything would magically work again-or you'd throw the machine out and get a new one. If you had no money, then you had no PC. It was brutal but honest.

The beauty of this approach wasn't the destruction-it was the clarity. One problem, one solution. Your computer either worked or it didn't.

## The Infinite Complexity Machine

Nowadays, you have all the information at your disposal. You have more knowledge than ever before, and it's all accessible. But you also have a billion freaking things that could go wrong, each with its own rabbit hole of potential causes.

You get an Error 41? Well, it could be your power supply, your cables, the latest Windows update, the latest manufacturer update, a driver conflict, a memory issue, overheating, a dying hard drive, corrupted system files, or-and I'm only half joking here, the butterfly that decided to flap its wings in Osaka at precisely the wrong moment.

It's paradoxically more confusing than it used to be, despite having access to vastly more information. We've traded the brutal simplicity of "format and pray" for the infinite complexity of "debug and despair."

## The Update Treadmill

You could blame the constant stream of updates. The 4 billion patches, security fixes, feature additions, and "improvements" that flow through our machines like a new create startup releases that never stops. Each update is a potential point of failure, a new way for things to break that worked perfectly yesterday.

Or maybe it's the hardware itself, designed now for replaceability rather than reliability. Components that used to last a decade are now expected to be swapped out every few years. Everything is modular, upgradeable, and somehow more fragile.

## The Paradox of Progress

Here's the thing that really gets me: we've made computers incredibly powerful and capable, but somehow less dependable. A modern laptop can run AI models (look at me, keeping up with the times!), process 4K video, and connect to a dozen devices simultaneously, but it can't consistently wake up from sleep without having an existential crisis. It stirs for a few seconds, decides it’s not in the mood, goes back to sleep, repeats three times and then reboots!

We've gained infinite possibilities and lost the simple certainty that our tools will work when we need them. It's like trading a reliable hammer for a Swiss Army knife that sometimes forgets how to be a screwdriver.

The old way was harsh but honest. The new way is sophisticated but maddening. I'm not sure which I prefer, but I know which one lets me actually get work done.

## The Real Question

Maybe the issue isn't Windows at all. Maybe it's that we've built systems so complex that no single person - not the user, not the support tech, not even the original programmers - truly understands how all the pieces fit together anymore.

We've created machines that are smarter than ever but somehow less predictable than a coin flip. And we've convinced ourselves this is progress.

The question isn't whether they make them like they used to. The question is: when did "better" stop meaning "more reliable"? Although if I'm being honest, I haven't had this kind of issue with the overrated and overpriced Mac laptops...
