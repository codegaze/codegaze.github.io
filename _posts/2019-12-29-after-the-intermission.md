I surely have not written something in a long while. I've concluded that I have the urge to share, when I need an alternative way of expression.

A lot has changed since I started this blog. Back in 2016, I moved to another company and I had too much on my plate. I moved from a full-time Engineer to Scrum Master and now Engineering Manager. I've also learned a lot about how products are built. It wasn't easy, but I feel I have found my true calling and something that keeps me on my toes.

I have different experiences now and I want to share some of my thoughts on people management and leadership. This doesn't mean I will stop writing about code or anything else. I am just shifting my main focus to other stuff. Of course, I hope this might be helpful to other people too.

If you have visited before, here are some more changes you will notice:

* New domain. No Github in it. Rants is something that can describe some of my posts, and I also find it funny!
* A new layout, hopefully, more readable. I'm sure I'll have some debugging and code clean up to do.
* An [About](/about) section, in which I share more stuff about me and this blog. It's time to be a bit more out there.
* Categories, in which you can find something you like, easier. Needs improvement I know.

That's all for now... Let's see how this will turn up!
