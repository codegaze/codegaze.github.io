categories: [Writing, External]

Since I've started writing again - yes, do I write, I kid you not - I try to find ways to become better at it. During my search for resources, I stumbled upon this workshop by Larry McEnerney for the University of Chicago Writing Program.

McEnerney shares some thoughts on writing style, how it is related to your readers, how important is the value of your writings outside of academia and why. Great stuff there. I don't want to say too much and spoil it for you.
