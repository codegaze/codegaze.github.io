January is ending and I already started experimenting a bit to work on this yearâ€™s themes, and more specifically on the physical and mental health area. How?

This week, I began taking a 15-20 minute break in the middle of my working day and spent that time on the treadmill with 3 minutes of running and 1 minute rest intervals. I usually manage to cover approximately a 1.5km distance.

So far, this routine has had various positive side effects on my day.

## Doing My Exercise
After injuring my knee (nothing serious but annoying), I became scared of going into a week of recovery and physiotherapy sessions again. As a result, I reduced my exercise and had to start from scratch again.

Twenty minutes per day of intervals seems to be a good pace for now. It's challenging enough for me, but it doesn't create any issues.

Until I start increasing this time again, it means I can do this exercise during my day as a break from work, which is one more side effect.

## Taking a Break
I must admit I struggle with taking breaks during my working hours. Even though I manage to maintain a work/life balance with a lot on my plate, breaks are something I find challenging. And even when I do take a break, I can't seem to forget about the work I'm leaving behind.

However, this changed. I close notifications, do some stretching, blast some music in my ears, push start and the treadmill and I can forget about everything for the next few minutes.

## Getting a Boost
Oh yes... the endorphins! Or maybe it's just a placebo. I don't know, but it works!

Some weekdays are challenging. I might find myself not fully energized during a meeting or a specific task in the midday, and I don't like it. Until now, I haven't found something that truly worked, but over the past week, I've been getting a lot of energy after doing the 15-minute workout.

## Not Another Fitness Buff
You might be wondering, "Why is this guy preaching about exercise?"

Well, I'm not. I will probably be the last person on Earth to do that. But I found a way to help me feel a bit better throughout my day. If I find an alternative way that doesn't require any effort, I'll probably prefer it.

So, if I had to leave you with a few things, it would be:

* Please take some breaks.
* Move a bit during these breaks.
* Find something to do that takes your mind off work and energizes you.
