High-performing teams are fascinating.

A team with the right values and a good flow in place moves a company forward. But it's never about speed. It's all about efficiency.

What happens, though, when day-to-day routine kicks in? Groups can get lost in their current goals and lose opportunities to make a difference. They lose the chance to see the impact of small initiatives in favour of day-to-day work that helps their primary goals.

At times, all that is needed is for an individual to raise their voice and a call to action.

"I believe this matters, and I need help".

A great team listens. A great team leans in. There is no need for roles, levels or permission. They just need a nudge from someone, and they will be there to solve a problem as a group. You are driving change with just a simple move.

High-performing teams are made of outstanding individuals.
