I really enjoyed watching Jeff Lawson's - CEO of Twilio - presentation about a company's values.

Whether you are doing your first professional steps in a start-up or you are a founder, you should check this one out. There are a lot of insights on how to create, revisit your company's values or even evaluate the values of the company you are a member of.
