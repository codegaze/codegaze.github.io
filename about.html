    <h2>Hello all!</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Thanos Kolovos</strong>, based in Athens, Greece, and
      currently the <strong>Associate Director of Engineering at GWI</strong>.
      Before that, I worked at Causaly and Transifex, leading and growing teams
      while shaping the engineering function. Earlier in my career, I worked
      with digital agencies and companies across Greece as both a Frontend and
      Backend Engineer, so yes, I’ve probably left a few security holes behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      What drives me is not just code but how teams and products evolve. Over
      the years, I’ve become fascinated by the human side of tech. What makes
      people tick, how great teams thrive, and how to help individuals grow
      while growing myself and creating amazing products.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This is my writing space.</strong> I started with
      <strong>coding topics</strong>, but now I explore
      <strong>leadership, management</strong>, and the
      <strong>human side of building products</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This space is my personal playground.

        project, or person I work with.</strong

      Stories may come from real experiences, be slightly dramatized, or
      entirely imagined.
