    <h2>Hello all!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Thanos Kolovos, I currently live in Athens, Greece, and work at <a href="https://www.transifex.com" target="_blank">Transifex</a> as an Engineering Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2005 I have worked with a lot of digital agencies and
      either small or big companies in Greece as a Frontend or Backend Engineer,
      so I'm positive I have my share of security holes out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I have become keen on performance optimization, UX and consistency.
      Stating the obvious, when I joined a product company, I became interested
      in how a product works and evolves and how great teams work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when I became a Scrum Master that I figured out I am fascinated
      about people, what makes them tick, what triggers them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, it has become my mission to better understand people, help them grow
      in any way I can, and of course, evolve as an individual during the process.
    </p>

    <h2>This place</h2>
    <p>Codegaze, is something that was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegazing" target="_blank">Shoegazing</a> and Rants, is something that I find descriptive of my writings and funny at the same time.</p>
    <p>I find it liberating to write about things. I started writing about coding, but right now I have expanded on other subjects, like people, management, or leadership.</p>
    <p>This place is my personal playground. Every single word is my own. It doesn't represent opinions of any company, project, or person, that I interact with.</p>
    <p>Any of the stories I write, may be originated from my experiences - a bit overdramatised - or be completely fictitious.</p>
